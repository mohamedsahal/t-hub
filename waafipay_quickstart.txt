   WaafiPay API Quickstart Guide

   Welcome to the WaafiPay API Quickstart guide! This document will help
   you set up and test your integration with WaafiPay's sandbox
   environment, allowing you to process secure transactions through cards,
   mobile wallets, and bank accounts.

Overview

   The WaafiPay API allows client applications to communicate directly
   with WaafiPay's secure servers in a predefined message format,
   facilitating smooth, real-time transactions. With multiple programming
   languages supported, WaafiPay makes it easy to integrate into your
   existing website or application.

   For code snippets and additional examples, refer to our Github
   repository. It contains sample integrations to help you get up and
   running quickly.
